      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>If the color scheme and pictures did not already make it obvious or maybe you're a newcomer to the world of Hoxxes IV,
        this page is dedicated to the driller class in Deep Rock Galactic. I myself am a big fan of the Driller, from the playstyle
        to the customizations this class was made for me. I hope after exploring this page you will feel the class is superior to the
        rest of the classes and find a love for the rugged dwarf known as the Driller.

      <h2>About Deep Rock Galactic</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/">Deep Rock Galactic</a> is a game about dwarves and mining. The game is set in space and the player(s) (dwarves) must
        complete missions assigned to them by their employer, Deep Rock Galactic. The missions span from a wide 
        variety of tasks from simply collecting morkite in a tame cave system to bulldozing your way through enemies 
        to stop rival companies from accomplishing their goals. Although the game is chaotic and you never know what
        to expect, one thing will always remain true. Rock and Stone!</p>

        
      <p>There are 4 playable classes to choose from:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The Engineer</li>
        <li>The Scout</li>
        <li>The Gunner</li>
        <li>The DRILLER</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- About the driller section -->
    <section id="About-the-driller">
      <h2>About the Driller</h2>

      <p>The driller is one of the four playable classes in the beloved video game Deep Rock Galactic.
      Personally my favorite class because who doesn't like digging? I would recommend this class to players who love destruction and chaos
      since the Driller is equipped with mines, a flamethrower, and a big ass drill. Alternatively you could use throwing axes, a variety of
      grenades, and a cryo cannon (ice flamethrower).</p>

      <h3>What makes the Driller so fun?</h3>
      <p>The driller makes an excellent class for players who like making their own path, literally. Is there no clear way to get to some nitra
        at the top of the cave? Just dig your way up there! The Driller doesn't allow anything to stop them and if you like the sound of that then
        you need to try the class. There are so many possible builds and the ability to just dig anywhere you want allows for so much creativity.
        Not only is the Driller excellent for solo play but they are the beating heart of any team. When there is a thick wall of rock and stone 
        in the cave and your team needs to get to the other side, who is everyone going to turn to? The Driller of course! 
      </p>

      <h3>They're always there for you</h3>
      <p>Finally, I would like to add that the Driller is the ultimate team player. There is a saying in Deep Rock Galactic, "No dwarf left behind". 
        Of course we would all like to make it to the escape pod at the end of the mission, but this can be a troubling and intense moment
        due to the complexity of the cave system. I would like to take this time to remind the engineers and gunners out there, that when that 
        stinking scout goes grappling across the cave and leaving us in their dust. The Driller will always be there to help carve a safe path
        for their team, like a true hero.
